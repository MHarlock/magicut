This project help me to store files only with magic number information: full directory tree; filename; mime.
magicut.py cut file to mantain exactly mime (magic number) and full pathname of original file.
So instead store, for instance, a movie.mkv with 4GB size magicut store only 64bytes
This help me to work on a filename parser similar to one used for multimedia file on Kodi.
